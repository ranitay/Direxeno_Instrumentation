\section{Experimental Setup}
\label{expSetup}
The experimental setup that is described in this section, is designed to measure, the properties of LXe scintillation. However it is designed in a modular way, so it can serve different requirements from different future experiments. There are three main building blocks consisting the full setup, The purification and circulation system, the cryogenic system, and the detector system. Each building block can be replaced without effecting the others. The full assembly (figure.~\ref{fig:fulldet}) is held on two separate wracks which are joined using a 100mm bar with shock absorbers on both sides.
