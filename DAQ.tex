channels. We use a heterogeneous system consisting of both

The schematic layout 
of the DAQ system is shown in Fig.~{\ref{Fig:DAQscheme}}. All the 20 PMTs 
are oriented in the holder assembly which was discussed in section \ref{subsubsec:sphere}. 
The PMTs are ramped up to +800V (the maximum is +900V) using a 24 channel 
VME high volatge distributor module \footnote{iseg VDS18130p}.  
We define the raw electrical pulse output of the PMTs as S{\it i} (raw), where {\it i} = 1 -- 20. 
These raw pulses are then 
amplified and shaped using two photomultiplier preamplifiers \footnote{Phillips 776. 
Each of the preamplifier model provides 16 independent  and direct-coupled 
amplifiers channels}. The preamplifier channels operates from DC to 275 MHz and 
produce two identical 50 $\Omega$ non inverting outputs with voltage gains of 10. 
We define the amplified pulses as S{\it i}, ({\it i} = 1 -- 20). One out of the 
two identical analog outputs from each channel is converted to a digital 
signal with an Analog to Digitizer converter \footnote{CAEN ADC V1742: Switched capacitor Digitizer}.

The ADC consists of two 12bit 5GS/s Switched capacitor Digitizer sections, 
each of them with 16+1 channels, based on DRS4 chip. The dynamic range of the input signal is 1 Vpp with adjustable DC offset. This module can sample either bipolar or unipolar analog input signal within the dynamic range in a circular 
analog memory buffer, with default sampling frequency choices 5GS/s, 2.5 GS/s 
or 2 GS/s. As soon as a trigger signal reaches, all the analog memory 
buffers gets frozen and then gets digitized into a digital memory buffer 
with a 12 bit resolution. 

\RanComment{I would drop the we, though here it is not that bad, bu t then maybe its better to say we trigger on ...} We generate an intrinsic trigger for the system, with the coincidence of any two out of the twenty PMTs. The second output from the preamplifier channels are converted to binary signals using two 16 channel leading Edge discriminator \footnote{CAEN V895}. In \sout{Fig.~\ref{Fig:DAQscheme}, we term} the binary outputs from the discriminator \RanComment{are denoted} as SD{\it i}, i= 1 -- 20. The SD{\it i} signals are then passed over to the logic module \footnote{CAEN V1495, an FPGA based General purpose VME board which is programmed to perform the 
logic operation} to obtain the trigger. \RanComment{I think this is redundent we already stated this} \sout{At present, the coincidence of any two out of the twenty PMTs forms the trigger logic.} The output of the logic operation is 
used to trigger the ADC. In order to record the PMT noise rate, the 
SD{\it i} signals are duplicated and fed to a scaler \footnote{CAEN V830}.




The PMT event information and the trigger rate are read from the ADC, while the Scaler records the PMT noise rate. The data readout to the acquisition PC is done through the Controller and optical link to the master PCIe card. \RanComment{not sure this is needed. but in any case I would move to present form}The further analyses of the relevant events in the PMTs will be carried out offline using an analysis framework.
