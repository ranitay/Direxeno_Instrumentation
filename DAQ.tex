The DAQ system is heterogeneous with both 
NIM and VME electronic modules. The data readout is being carried out through a PCIe card\footnote{CAEN A3818 PCIe} 
connected via an optical link to a VME controller\footnote{CAEN V2718 VME controller}. A schematic layout of the DAQ system is shown in Fig.~{\ref{Fig:DAQscheme}}.

The PMTs are ramped up to +800V (the maximum is +900V) using VME high voltage distributor module\footnote{iseg VDS18130p : 
24 independent channels positive polarity voltage distributer}. The raw pulses from the PMTs are amplified and shaped using 
two PMT preamplifiers\footnote{Phillips 776. 16 independent and direct-coupled amplifiers channels}. The preamplifier operates 
from DC to 275 MHz and produces two identical 50 $\Omega$ non inverting outputs with voltage gains of 10 for each PMT channel. One 
of the outputs is converted into a digital signal by an ADC\footnote{CAEN ADC V1742: switched capacitor digitizer}, and the other to 
binary signals using two discriminators\footnote{CAEN V895 16 channel leading edge discriminator}.

        consists of 20 PMTs ({\it i} = 1 -- 20) and the subsequent electronic channels to record 
        the events for an internal trigger generated by the coincidence of any 
        two PMTs in the system and also the PMT noise rate. Where S{\it i}(raw) is the raw electrical pulse output of the PMTs, S{\it i} are 
        the amplified pulses, and SD{\it i} are the binary outputs from the discriminator.

%The schematic layout 
%of the DAQ system is shown in Fig.~{\ref{Fig:DAQscheme}}. All the 20 PMTs 
%are oriented in the holder assembly which was discussed in section \ref{subsubsec:sphere}. 
%The PMTs are ramped up to +800V (the maximum is +900V) using a 24 channel 
%VME high voltage distributor module \footnote{iseg VDS18130p : 24 independent channels with positive polarity}.  
%The raw electrical pulse output of the PMTs are defined as S{\it i} (raw), where {\it i} = 1 -- 20. 
%These raw pulses are then 
%amplified and shaped using two photomultiplier preamplifiers \footnote{Phillips 776: 16 independent  and direct-coupled 
%amplifiers channels}. The preamplifier channels operates from DC to 275 MHz and 
%produce two identical 50 $\Omega$ non inverting outputs with voltage gains of 10. 
%The amplified pulses as defined as S{\it i}, ({\it i} = 1 -- 20). One out of the 
%two identical analog outputs from each channel is converted to a digital 
%signal with an Analog to Digitizer converter \footnote{CAEN ADC V1742: 
%32 channel switched capacitor Digitizer}. 


The ADC consists of two 12bit 5GS/s switched capacitor digitizer sections, 
each of them with 16+1 channels, based on DRS4 chip. The dynamic range of the input signal is 1 
Vpp with an adjustable DC offset. This module constantly samples (5GS/s, 2.5 GS/s or 2 GS/s) either bipolar or unipolar analog input 
signals, and records them into circular 
analog memory buffers. Once triggered, all analog memory 
buffers are frozen and digitized into a digital memory buffer 
with a 12 bit resolution. 

The binary output signals from the discriminator are duplicated and fed to 
the logic module\footnote{CAEN V1495: FPGA based general purpose VME board} and to a scaler\footnote{CAEN V830: 16 channel scalar} 
A global majority trigger is generated in the logic module with the coincidence of any two out of 
the twenty PMTs within a time window of \RanComment{XXX\,ns}. The event information and trigger rate are read from the ADC, while the 
individual PMTs trigger rate from the scaler. Further analyses of the relevant events are carried out offline.
