\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}

We have presented Direxeno, a setup to measure the spatial distribution of LXe scintillation. The system described is built from 4 main building (gas handling system, cryogenic, detector, and DAQ) blocks which can be exchanged without effecting others. This property allows flexibility and modularity.

We have presented the sensitivity to different postulated non isotropic emission types, and a test statistics to quantify them. For all of them a run time of 2-3 weeks is required assuming standard radioactive sources. Therefore the system is designed to maintain stability.

Using Direxeno, effects like superradiance or any other non-linear scintillation can be measured. Measuring the correlation between the direction of the emission and the direction of the radioactive source, may lead to directionality measurement which will allow reducing of background and improving sensitivity in DM experiments.
