\textbf{Maye change to the two features we want to measure is temporal and spatial; therefore, we need stability (spatial) and fast response(temporal)}.


In order for this system to be able to measure \superradiance\ effects there are two important features the system needs to meet: stability and fast response. The estimated time for accumulating data to achieve a 5$\sigma$ effect assuming standard radioactive sources and some postulated emission patterns(see Sec.~\ref{sec:sim})
