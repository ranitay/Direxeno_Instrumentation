trial.txt - information for the isotropic lines.
Fig10.C  - original file from moon moon with data that holds the anisotropic curves data and reads the isotropic information from the file. 
           HYL made some minor changes to it, including shaded areas creation, and saving the TGraphs to a root file.
           root script. ".x Fig10.C"
Fig10.root - holds all the relevant information as TGraphs.
draw10.c - HYL root macro that reads the information from the root file above and plots the figure .

To use these scripts:

1. If not done already, generate the root file holding the information as TGraphs objects: 
 root Fig10.C
2. run the macro to read this root file and make the plot:
 root draw10.c

Changes to the figures graphics should be made to draw10.c
